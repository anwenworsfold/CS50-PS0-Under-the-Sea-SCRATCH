# PS0-Under-the-Sea-SCRATCH
Using the mouse, you drag the shark around the scene, trying to eat the little fish. 
The fish swim around randomly at different speeds. 
The faster the fish the more points it will give you. 
When the shark eats a fish it "chomps" by changing costume. When the fish dies it turns into a little ghost and a bubbly sound is played, before it respawns. 
There is also a crab pinching its way along the bottom of the screen. 
If the shark touches the pinchy crab it shouts "Ouch!", looks deflated, and loses points. 
The crab yells "Gotcha!". The shark then returns to normal and the crab continues on its path. 
In addition to this the game is timed. 
You have 30 seconds to get as many points as possible. 
When the timer runs out you can no longer score points or be hurt by the crab- the game freezes and the crab tells you "Time's up!"
